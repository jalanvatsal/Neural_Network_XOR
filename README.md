# Neural_Network_XOR
This is a custom feedforward neural network using Python - following an object-oriented approach - to address the XOR problem. 
This project utilizes Deep Learning principles including the implementation of activation functions, loss functions, and back-propagation techniques for efficient neural network architecture. 
I have conducted hyper-parameter tuning to optimize model performance.
